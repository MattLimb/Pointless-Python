# Pointless-Python
A repository full of pointless scripts and applications built in Python3.

Please check dependencies before running any of these scripts or applications using:
```bash
sudo python3 check_depends.py
```

Please Note - This repo is designed for a Linux operating system, and not for Windows or MacOS. check_depends will not run if it is ran on those operating systems.

This repo was built on Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop.

# Future Developments - Linux
1. Add bash scripts which launch the scripts from the command line.
2. Add setup.py which will copy the files into the right places.
3. Incorperate check_depends.py into setup.py
